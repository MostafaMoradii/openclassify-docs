# Directory Permissions

After installing, you may need to configure some permissions in order to proceed. Directories within the `storage`, `public/app`, and the `bootstrap/cache` directories should be writable by your web server. If you are using the [Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/homestead) virtual machine, these permissions should already be set.
